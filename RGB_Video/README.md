# RGB Video Modification
## Background
This design is based on the Matra Alice schematic.  The Alice outputs an RGB+Audio signal via a 7-pin DIN socket - this would normally be connected to a Peritel or SCART connector.<br>

## Status
15-Mar-2025:<br>
Work in progress!<br>
The schematic is almost complete, verifying against the Alice schematic (a bit hard to see some parts) and an actual Alice.<br>
A PCB will then be designed and test PCBs fabricated.
