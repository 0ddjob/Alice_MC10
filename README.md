# Internal 4KB-to-8KB RAM Upgrade
This design is based on the work that Daniel Tufvesson documented on his [blog](https://www.waveguide.se/?article=expanding-the-trs-80-mc-10-internal-ram) for the Tandy TRS-80 MC-10.<br>

The MC-10 has a limitation with component height due to its rather [snug FCC shielding](https://www.waveguide.se/?article=getting-to-know-the-trs-80-mc-10) - the Matra Alice doesn't have this, hence this simple daughterboard design.  My MC-10 no longer has that limitation either!<br>

The Alice also doesn't have the bodge wiring for the 4KB address decoding that the MC-10 has.<br>

This is what the 8KB daughterboard looks like installed in the Alice:<br>
